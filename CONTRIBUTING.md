## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Contribution Setup

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub (click the Fork button)

# 2. Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Serendipity-AI.git
cd Serendipity-AI

# 3. Set up development environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature

# 5. Make your changes and test locally
python main.py
# Visit http://localhost:8000 to test your changes

# 6. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add amazing new feature that does X"

# 7. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature

# 8. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Always work on feature branches** - Never commit directly to main
2. **Write clear commit messages** - Describe what and why, not just what
3. **Test your changes** - Make sure everything works before submitting
4. **Keep PRs focused** - One feature or fix per pull request
5. **Update documentation** - If you change functionality, update docs too

## 📝 Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- **Comments**: Write clear, helpful comments for complex logic
- **Naming**: Use descriptive variable and function names
- **Formatting**: Consider using `black` for consistent formatting

```bash
# Install development tools
pip install black flake8 pytest

# Format code
black main.py

# Check style
flake8 main.py

# Run tests
pytest
```

### Commit Messages
Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
# Good examples:
git commit -m "Add session timeout functionality to prevent memory leaks"
git commit -m "Fix OpenAI API error handling for rate limits"
git commit -m "Update README with deployment instructions"

# Avoid:
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "update stuff"
git commit -m "changes"
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

When creating a pull request:

1. **Use a descriptive title** that explains what the PR does
2. **Fill out the PR template** (if provided) completely
3. **Link related issues** using "Fixes #123" or "Addresses #456"
4. **Add screenshots** for UI changes
5. **Test your changes** thoroughly before submitting
6. **Keep PRs small and focused** - easier to review and merge

### Example PR Description
```markdown

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio httpx

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=main

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_chat.py
```

### Writing Tests
When adding new features, please include tests:

```python
# Example test structure
def test_chat_endpoint():
    """Test that chat endpoint returns valid response"""
    response = client.post("/chat", json={
        "message": "Hello", 
        "session_id": "test"
    })
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "response" in response.json()
```
