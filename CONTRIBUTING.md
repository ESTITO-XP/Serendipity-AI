## 🧠 Philosophy

- Every **commit is an artifact**
- Prioritize **modularity, readability, and polish**
- Respect the **builder flow—no clutter, no assumptions**
- README is a **living document**, not a static file
- Treat every workflow (backup, export, layout) as a **reflection of founder ethos**

---

1. **Fork** the repo  
2. Create a **feature branch** (`git checkout -b feature-name`)  
3. Make **modular, well-documented changes**
4. Submit a **pull request with a clear changelog**
5. **Respect** layout logic and naming conventions
