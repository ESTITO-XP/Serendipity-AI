### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements request throttling to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **CORS Protection**: Configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses that don't expose system details

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

## üîê Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers
```bash
# Always use environment variables for API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Never commit .env files
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Use strong, unique API keys
# Rotate keys regularly
```

### For Deployment
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Keep dependencies updated regularly
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns
- Implement proper logging for security events
- Use secure headers in production

### Recommended Environment Setup
```python
# In production, consider additional security measures:
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
from fastapi.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware

# Add security headers
app.add_middleware(TrustedHostMiddleware, allowed_hosts=["*.yourdomain.com"])
```
