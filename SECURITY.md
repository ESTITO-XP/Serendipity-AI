# Never commit .env files
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```
- Use strong, unique keys and rotate regularly.

**Deployment**
- Always use HTTPS
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for unusual usage
- Use security headers

**Sample Python Setup**

from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer
from fastapi.middleware.trustedhost import TrustedHostMiddleware

app.add_middleware(TrustedHostMiddleware, allowed_hosts=["*.yourdomain.com"])
```
